# GuessNumberGame
This is a React Native app that implements a number guessing game where the user thinks of a number, and the app attempts to guess it. The user provides feedback (higher or lower) after each guess, and the app adjusts its next guess accordingly. The app keeps track of all the guesses made during the game.

Features:
User Input: User selects a number between 1 and 100.
App Guessing Logic: The app guesses the number based on user feedback (higher or lower).
Guess History: A list of all the guesses made by the app is displayed.
Game End: The game ends when the app correctly guesses the number.

Technologies Used:
React Native
React Hooks 
FlatList for displaying guess history
